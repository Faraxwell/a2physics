## Introduction

This is a set of very concise lecture notes written for [CIE A-level Physics](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-international-as-and-a-level-physics-9702/) (syllabus code 9231). Presumably the target audience of the notes are students studying the relevant course.

I have started typesetting my handwritten notes into LaTeX since a long time ago, but this work never appears to get any close to completion. There are around 15 chapters to cover in the course, as you will see in the list below. I have finished typesetting the first 10 chapters - more than half of the whole project. Hopefully, this number will continue to grow.

## How to Use

Master file: a-level-physics.tex

The master file references the included chapters, each chapter is in separated .tex file as suggested by file names.

My default compiler is XeLaTeX, which is recommended. PdfLaTeX also works fine for me. I am not sure about other compilers.

If you are a student, you might simply want to [download the compiled .pdf file](https://github.com/yuhao-yang-cy/a2physics/blob/master/a-level-physics.pdf) for your own use.
