## collaborator's word

I am a student who graduated from high school two years ago and I am now a university student. I have benefited greatly from these notes in the past and I would like to write some solutions of end-chapter-questions for this lecture notes. Sometimes I will add some new questions besides the original-exisiting ones. I will not change anything about the content except typos.

## Introduction

This is a set of very concise lecture notes written for [CIE A-level Physics](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-international-as-and-a-level-physics-9702/) (syllabus code 9702). Presumably the target audience of the notes are students studying the relevant course.

Note that there has been an update for the syllabus since 2022. The owner is still working on the updates so that the notes are tailored for the new syllabus. The owner is am glad to see some *introductory astronomy and cosmology* being added into the new syllabus, so you will see one new chapter coming in.

The contents of *electronics* and *telecommunication* have been removed from the new syllabus. As those future engineers might want to look at these topics, so the owner is kept the two chapters in the new edition nonetheless.

Also very importantly, The owner is certain that there are tons of typos in the notes. If you spot any error, please let him know

## How to Use

Master file: a-level-physics.tex

The master file references the included chapters, each chapter is in separated .tex file as suggested by file names.

My default compiler is PdfLaTeX, which is recommended. XeLaTeX also works fine for me. I am not sure about other compilers.

If you are a student, you might simply want to [download the compiled .pdf file](https://github.com/yuhao-yang-cy/a2physics/blob/master/a2physics.pdf) for your own use.
