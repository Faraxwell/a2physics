This is a set of very concise lecture notes written for CIE A-level Physics (syllabus code 9231). Presumably the target audience of the notes are students studying the relevant course.

I have started typesetting my handwritten notes into LaTeX since a long time ago, but this work never appears to get any close to completion.

There are around 15 chapters to cover in the course, but till now, I have only finished typesetting the first 7 chapters. Hopefully, this number will continue to grow.

Master file a-level-physics.tex references the included chapters, each in separated tex files as suggested by file names.
