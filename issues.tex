\subsection*{Contacts}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Email}: \url{colin-young@live.com}

\item \textbf{Office Hours}

There is no specific office hour. You can try to find me at my office 9am - 5pm, Monday to Friday. If you have questions about the course, I also recommend you to catch me right after any of my lectures.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Lecture Notes}

The latest update can be downloaded via \url{http://sdrv.ms/MuGXKC}.

These lecture notes are not yet complete. I will follow them up with the development of the course.

Also very importantly, I am certain that there are tons of typos in the notes. If you spot any errors, please let me know.


\subsection*{Literature}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Textbook}: Cambridge International AS and A Level Physics Coursebook, by \textit{David Sang, Graham Jones, Richard Woodside} and \textit{Gurinder Chadha}, Cambridge University Press 2010
\end{itemize}

The structure of these notes and the contents covered here are basically consistent with textbook, but there might be various differences.

Throughout these notes, key points are marked red and underlined, important formulas are boxed. Anything beyond the CIE syllabus is labelled with a star sign ($\star$), which usually show up in the footnotes.
